      <h2 id="analysis-process-heading">Analysis Process</h2>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Position Identification</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Scan official websites and campaign materials for stated policy positions</li>
        <li>Extract specific policy commitments and goals</li>
        <li>Categorize positions into major policy areas:
          <ul>
            <li>Healthcare</li>
            <li>Climate Change & Environment</li>
            <li>Economic Policy</li>
            <li>Immigration</li>
            <li>Criminal Justice</li>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>Foreign Policy & Defense</li>
            <li>Civil Rights</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Document source and date of each position</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 2: Public Statement Collection</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Search verified news sources for quotes and statements</li>
        <li>Cross-reference statements with multiple sources when possible</li>
        <li>Assign credibility scores based on:
          <ul>
            <li>Source reliability (news outlet credibility rating)</li>
            <li>Context provided (full quote vs. partial)</li>
            <li>Verification status (on-the-record vs. anonymous)</li>
            <li>Corroboration from multiple outlets</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Categorize statements by policy area</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 3: Voting Record Analysis</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Retrieve official voting records from Congress.gov</li>
        <li>Identify votes relevant to stated policy positions</li>
        <li>Categorize votes by policy area</li>
        <li>Note vote explanation when available</li>
        <li>Account for procedural vs. substantive votes</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 4: Alignment Calculation</h3>
      <p>For each policy area, we calculate alignment using the following factors:</p>
      
      <h4>Consistency Score (40% weight)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct alignment between stated positions and voting record</li>
        <li>Weighted by importance and directness of votes</li>
        <li>Accounts for evolving positions over time</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Statement Coherence (35% weight)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Consistency between stated positions and public statements</li>
        <li>Weighted by statement credibility score</li>
        <li>Considers context and circumstances of statements</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Action Alignment (25% weight)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Legislative actions taken beyond voting (sponsorship, amendments, etc.)</li>
        <li>Committee work and advocacy efforts</li>
        <li>Public advocacy and leadership on issues</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="content-section" aria-labelledby="scoring-heading">
      <h2 id="scoring-heading">Scoring System</h2>
      
      <div class="scoring-legend">
        <h3>Alignment Score Ranges</h3>
        <div class="score-range">
          <span class="score-badge score-high">80-100%</span>
          <strong>High Alignment:</strong> Strong consistency between stated positions, public statements, and voting record
        </div>
        
        <div class="score-range">
          <span class="score-badge score-medium">60-79%</span>
          <strong>Moderate Alignment:</strong> Generally consistent with some notable discrepancies or evolving positions
        </div>
        
        <div class="score-range">
          <span class="score-badge score-low">Below 60%</span>
          <strong>Low Alignment:</strong> Significant inconsistencies between stated positions and actions
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Factors That May Affect Scores</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Evolving Positions:</strong> Politicians may legitimately change their views based on new information</li>
        <li><strong>Tactical Voting:</strong> Strategic votes that don't reflect core positions</li>
        <li><strong>Compromise:</strong> Votes on imperfect legislation that partially aligns with stated goals</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Data:</strong> New politicians or those with limited public records</li>
        <li><strong>Context:</strong> Statements taken out of context or misrepresented</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" aria-labelledby="limitations-heading">
      <h2 id="limitations-heading">Limitations and Caveats</h2>
      
      <h3>What We Cannot Measure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intent:</strong> We analyze actions and statements, not motivations</li>
        <li><strong>Private Positions:</strong> Positions not stated publicly cannot be analyzed</li>
        <li><strong>Future Actions:</strong> Our analysis is based on past behavior</li>
        <li><strong>Context Nuance:</strong> Complex political situations may require subjective interpretation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data Freshness</h3>
      <p>
        Our data is updated regularly, but there may be delays between when actions occur 
        and when they appear in our analysis. Voting records are typically updated within 
        24-48 hours, while statement analysis may take longer due to verification processes.
      </p>

      <h3>Bias Mitigation</h3>
      <p>
        While we strive for objectivity, any analysis involves some degree of interpretation. 
        We mitigate bias by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using consistent methodology across all politicians</li>
        <li>Relying on factual, verifiable information</li>
        <li>Providing transparent source citations</li>
        <li>Welcoming feedback and corrections</li>
        <li>Regular review of our processes by independent advisors</li>
      </ul>
